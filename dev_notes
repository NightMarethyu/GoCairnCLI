Need to standarize items, weapons, and magic
items should have a size 0, 1, or 2. meaning Petty, regular, and Bulky. Should be easy to integrate with the inventory in this way.
Items will need a size, number of uses, description, magical property
I'll probably need to have the magic spells be more standardized, then I can put the magical property in the item and have the items reference the magic list
weapons will need to have all the item properties as well as damage.
Magic will also probably need to be considered as a weapon if it can do damage.
I'll also need armor which will need to be counted as an item and include an armor amount and maybe where it can be equipped

I'll need to add NPCs including villians, minions, townspeople, faction members, and hirelings
I'll probably want a party system so that the player can have a party of other adventurers or hirelings with them
I'll need to keep track of faction goals and progress so that the world evolves around the player as they explore
